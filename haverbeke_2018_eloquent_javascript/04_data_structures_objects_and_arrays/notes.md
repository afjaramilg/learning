# data structures: objects and arrays

## other
`[3]` talks about what the fuck unicode actually is and all the different standards. this is worth considering if youre turning a string into an array of characters, for example. `[4]` is a suggested library for the purpose of splitting the graphemes correctly depending on the language.

i think in the future it is worth looking into if `[3]` provides the information needed to make sure only characters of length at most 16-bit are valid in an input box, for example, or if there is a way to forcibly display pairs as their 16-bit components.
